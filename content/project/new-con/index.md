This project is focused on analysing the effects of new construction on existing rents. I utilize a panel dataset from the real estate analytics firm [CoStar](https://www.costar.com/) in conjuction with the [Minnesota Housing Partnership (MHP)](https://www.mhponline.org/) and my co-author Christopher Frenier at the University Minnesota.


Presentation slides are from the 2019 Urban Affairs Association Conference. Working paper is expected soon. All results are preliminary.
