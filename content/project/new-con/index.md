Co-authored with [Christopher Frenier](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/christopherfrenier/) at the University Minnesota, this project explores the effects of new, market-rate construction on existing rents. A previous version of this paper was presented at the Urban Affairs Association Conference (UAA) in 2019. [Click here for a recent slide deck](https://www.tonydamiano.com/project/new-con/supply-ppt.pdf).

We are finishing up a public working paper, which will be released by the end of February 2020. 

This project is made possible by support from the [Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA)](http://www.cura.umn.edu/) and [the Minnesota Housing Partnership (MHP)](https://www.mhponline.org/)
