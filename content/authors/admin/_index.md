Hello!

My name is Anthony Damiano and I am a PhD candidate at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. I received a master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning at the Humphrey School and my undergraduate degree in Political Science at Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI. I grew up in Iowa City, IA.

I work as a research assistant at the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA). Before starting my PhD degree, I worked the Community GIS Program at CURA providing GIS technical assistance to local neighborhood organizations and non-profits.

My research interests include housing policy, community-based research, race and inequality. I do mostly quantitative analysis using R, Stata and ArcGIS. I believe the best and most useful research comes through the co-production of knowlege by and with marginalized communities.
